## The lowercase "i" pronoun

It is not by accident that i spell "i" lowercase. This is a personal preference.
I don't know of any other language that capitalizes the first person singular
pronoun, and i don't understand the reason to do so. As if i didn't have enough
ego, that i need to capitalize my pronoun... Feels weird.
