## Preface: the lowercase "i" pronoun

It is not by accident that i spell "i" lowercase. You might run into this here
and there. This is a personal preference.  I don't know of any other language
that capitalizes the first person singular pronoun, and i don't understand the
reason to do so. As if i didn't have enough ego, that i need to capitalize my
pronoun... Feels weird.
