## Curriculum/Resume

Being so adimate about informatics standards, i couldn't but use a standard also
for the CV: i have used the EuropassCV format. The PDF was generated from the
[europass European Union](https://europa.eu/europass/) website and it includes
the CV in Europass XML format. You can extract the XML with `pdfdetach`.

The europass website also allows one to generate an HTML version which looks
