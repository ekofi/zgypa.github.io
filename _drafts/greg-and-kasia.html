<p>We had colatia with Greg and Kasia. Nice people. Greg was going to Geneva for a meeting to speak at the UN. He is a gay activist. </p>
<p> Kasia has just finished an exposition about GLT rights, told us how there is another group interested in borrowing it. </p>
<p> Both involved with GLT rights . I found them to be very nice. </p>
