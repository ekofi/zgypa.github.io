<h2>Be aware of <a class="zem_slink" title="eBay" href="http://ebay.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">eBay</a> seller arrindy!</h2>
<p><em>UPDATE: in the meanwhile, i was able to get in touch with the store (<a href="http://www.arrindy.com">www.arrindy.com</a>), and they seem to be willing to helping me out. Haven't received any money yet.</em></p>
<p><em>eBay seller arrindy</em> has shipped the incorrect item (not the one described) and has refused to refund the return shipping expenses by ignoring the attempts i have made to contact the seller. Please be aware of this seller, as the seller did not behave in a professional manner.</p>
<p>The reason why i'm writing this post is also because i have mistakenly left positive feedback to transaction <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/321100714782">http://www.ebay.com/itm/321100714782</a> (very frustrating). This means i now have no other way of expressing these opinions. I was going to leave NEGATIVE feedback instead.</p>
<p>Even if i received a "full" refund, it didn't include the return shipping, which cost me around $20. <em>eBay seller arrindy</em> also communicated poorly and omitted replies to the requests for a real full refund. I have warned <em>arrindy</em> that i would have left negative feedback for our  transaction, if <em>arrindy</em> were not to refund return shipping as well, and <em>eBay arrindy</em> never replied back. Then, while leaving multiple feedbacks for other transactions, i thought i was leaving feedback for the replacement item i had to purchase (because of this situation), and instead i mistakenly left positive feedback to <em>eBay arrindy</em>.</p>
<p>While it is true that the <em>eBay arrindy</em> did refund initial shipping and the cost of the unwanted items, i still ended up having to pay a sum of money for a mistake the seller has made, This, in addition to the time i spent to search and purchase the item for a second time from another seller, created a discomfort on my part, which was not fully recognized by <em>eBay arrindy</em>.</p>
