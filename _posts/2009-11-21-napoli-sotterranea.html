<p>With Olga i went to see the underground Naples. The interesting part was that we so happened to see it on TV the night before in the hotel.Pretty amazing to feel how much that space had been used by humans over the centuries, for water, for war shelter. Our guide was cute and excited to explain. Interesting steel manikin, which i think the guide disliked, used to simulate the dudes who would crawl in to clean the water tanks when it was used for water.</p>
