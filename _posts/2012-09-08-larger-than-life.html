<p>Watched today, gifted by Olga, seen in English.</p>
<p>The movie made me laugh a few times, and is neither a violent movie, nor one that makes use of sex scenes just to grab more attention. However, i was not impressed by the acting of most characters, except for Blockhead and his wife and Vera. I read in a review that the energy level of <a class="zem_slink" title="Bill Murray" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Bill Murray</a> was low in that movie, which lead the other actors to perform accordingly, and in a way i tend to agree. It kind of felt like Murray was really just doing this movie for the money.</p>
<p>Nothing new about this movie, apart, maybe, the fact that the sidekick is an elephant.</p>
