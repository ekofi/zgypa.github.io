I'm not usually fond of romances. Great performance from Patricia Clarkson, very well casted.</p>
<p>A sad story of a woman traveling all the way to Cairo to meet her husband and spend some time together, only to be greeted at the airport by one of his friends. Her husband doesn't seem to apologetic for not being there with her. It doesn't look like he understands how hard it is for her. That's sad.</p>
<p>No, i didn't enjoy it particularly. I don't like watching romances on the screen: i prefer living them. Sure, for the protagonist, that trip to Cairo will always remain in her memories. Don't we all have romances, one way or the other? This one didn't really seem worth while a movie. It felt like a plain old classic romantic situation to me. Maybe that's what the film maker was shooting for...</p>
<p>But for someone who enjoys romances, i think this movie could be very entertaining! :-)</p>
