<p>Seen at Ciap√®e, first movie on projector an screen.</p>
<p>It is nice to see the army engaged in completely different activities, like yoga, praying, meditation, dance and instigating individuality. It is also nice to see a whole camp on drugs. Fact is, the story's message is that while it would be possible to defy war with peace and love, us humans are not ready for it. And this is most appearant in the film critics and reviews: according to wikipedia it didn't rank well at all, with most critics being related to how the army was presented (farcical). Seems like people take it too seriously.</p>
