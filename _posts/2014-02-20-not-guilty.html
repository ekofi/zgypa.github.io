<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/02/20140220-103133.jpg" alt="20140220-103133.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" width="95%" /></p>

<p>Ads like these could be illegal, in my opinion. Not only for the content of
the ad per se, also for promoting anti-ethical behavior: it's a message saying
"it's ok not to be ethical, you can do it too, and you won't suffer from
negative consequences". The same message comes across by the fact that there is
an agency that is willing to help such behavior by posting billboards around
Chicago. So the reader looks at it, and thinks "well then maybe it's not that
bad after all..." even if his/her conscience tells them otherwise.</p>
