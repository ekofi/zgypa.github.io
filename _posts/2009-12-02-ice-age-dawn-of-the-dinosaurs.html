<p>Another movie seen on airplane, ams jfk. Another animation walt disney family style. A fun watch. Great job with the animation like as usual. </p>
<p> A pleasant love and caring entertainment. It teaches that sticking toghether and helping each other out will get people a long ways. However, the fact that Buck is solo and alive, the crocodile dundee figure/1930s hunter Frank Buck, sort of contrasts this moral. </p>
