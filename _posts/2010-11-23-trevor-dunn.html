<p>I just purchased the latest Trevor Dunn album. I like it for now...</p>
<p>I really liked how I ran into this guy in Verona, because of a mr. Bungle sticker. We exchanged emails and je wrote that Calomito also sounds like Trevor Dunn's stuff. I immediately googled him. Once I realized he is an SC3 contributor, it was real easy to do the final step.</p>
