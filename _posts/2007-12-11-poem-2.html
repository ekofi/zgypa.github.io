<p><em>(Poem by Stacy Foster)</em></p>
<pre>        I've painted my nails royal blue</pre>
<pre>        and dyed my hair deep purple
<pre>        I'm sad and passionate
        but everyone has been misconcieved</pre>
<pre>        I stroll around pulled</pre>
<pre>        by my center of gravity</pre>
<pre>        which is at my heart</pre>
<pre>        I'm guilty of giving someone new</pre>
<pre>        a chance to win me over</pre>
<pre>        Ran out of ammunition</pre>
<pre>        then decided I wasn't worth fighting for</pre>
<pre>
        So, I left with my hands</pre>
<pre>        in my pockets and my head looking</pre>
<pre>        up at the clouds, moon and stars</pre>
<pre>        Funny how I'm not surprised but</pre>
<pre>        by the tone of my hand I think otherwise</pre>
<pre>        these twenty-two line poems spinning</pre>
<pre>        in my head</pre>
<pre>        and I got it all down</pre>
<pre>        Right here</pre>
<pre>At my side</pre>
