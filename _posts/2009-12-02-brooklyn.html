<p>That's the CD name of a trio named 'PROJECT'. </p>
<p> I really liked it. Now i don't know if i did cuz i haven't been listening to music in a while, or cuz its really good. It sounds fresh, new and not boring, although the entire album contains the dame 3 musicians playing the dame 3 instruments. </p>
<p> The artists took me for a walkabout around Brooklyn, through known and unknown neighbourhoods. The unknown helped me get a feel for their sound and their brilliant ideas, the known put that knowledge into context: it felt like applying pure math to real life physical applications. </p>
<p> The CD ends with a modern interpretation of Peter and the Wolf, in which the artists do a great job with the voices as well. </p>
<p> The sound of Greg Portillo on the flute is really amazing, especially the power he's got on the higher octaves. I really liked his improvisations, which kept me on the toes, without giving much for granted... But then again, i might be biased, just cuz i know him. </p>
<p> Reccomend. </p>
