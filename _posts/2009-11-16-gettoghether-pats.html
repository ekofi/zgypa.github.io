<p>On saturday night pat cooked chicken with his own herbs, and did a great job. Really tasty and well cooked. Then for dessert he prepared apple pies. Perfect. It was for Rebecca, Fynn, Bob, Thom, Michelle and mum and dad. Escept mum and dad din't come cuz they didn't feel comfortable coming. Maybe they felt out of place. </p>
