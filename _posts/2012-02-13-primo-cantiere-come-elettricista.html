<p>Here i am working on my first official complete job as an electrician. It's a small apartment, however a complete job. I redid the electrical box, which was mess, disabled the old wiring system, which was falling apart.</p>
<p>It was fun! I had no idea how much it would take me. I used one color for switches: purchasing 4-5 colors would have been too expensive for that small apartment. I thought it would have been more complicated, however the circuitry was pretty simple, so it all went pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>I decided to bring the mains in with 4mm2 and 2.5mm2 for the rest. The switching wire is 1.5mm2 and all light outlets are grounded, with brown, blu yellow 2.5mm2. I decided not to run the purple switched wire directly to the lights. I figured it would be more intuitive to figure out the circuit this way.</p>
