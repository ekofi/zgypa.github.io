<p>Personal experience using a prepaid SIM in London.</p>
<p>I paid 10£ for 500MB of data and 300 text messages in the UK. However:</p>
<p>- Internet is by default content filtered. The user must ask to deactivate content filtering, which can take upto midnight. I was unable to access Fring.com.</p>
<p>- Was not able to WiFi tether. Personal Hotspot mode on iPhone is not allowed at all, apparently, for pay as you go cards.</p>
<p>- 3G network works pretty well around London. Coverage is present pretty much anywhere, however not always very strong. I often worked with 1 or 2 bars. Sufficient.</p>
<p>- I was about to buy a mobile wifi hotspot, however I was told they are all lock to provider. So I decided not to get it.</p>
<p>- when I first purchased the SIM, the clerk made a mistake and topped off the 10£ to another phone number. Before leaving the store, I was told it would take some time for the top off to go through, because they had a problem with the top off system. This was not true. In reality the clerk had topped off a different number. I could have checked the number by dialing *#100# on the phone to make sure it matched the number on the receipt. I had to return to the store to get it fixed.</p>
<p>- Even though the sim card is immediately active, the freebee promotion or offer takes a few hours to activate. Once topped off, Internet must remain off, otherwise the user will eat off the top off credit.</p>
<p>- both Fring and Skype are heavily firewalled: while they work, on the 3G network, packets are dropped at a very high rate, making the voice communication practically useless. I tried to make test phone calls on both networks and the quality was identical, even with speed test results of 1Mbit up and 3Mbit down.</p>
<p>- international SMS are very expensive, around 30p each.</p>
<p>- phone calls are about 26p/min, also very expensive.</p>
