<p>The A-Team</p>
<p>Seen on delta flight ATL CDG 10-10-10</p>
<p>It was great to see the A team come back to life, even with different actors. By using different actors, they were able to maintain the same age and spirit. From that aspect it felt quite a bit  like the old school a team. </p>
<p>However, it was nothing more than the usual Hollywood violent war film with a different skin on. Excessive violence, the goods kill the bads at the first shot, the bads keep missing even trivial shots, woman has no personality and are just hot and complex scenes are sped through really fast. The cool scenes of them building stuff have been minimized in favor of shooting scenes. It seems like movies today can't have too much shooting anymore... Will we get to the point in which there will be only shooting?</p>
<p>Don't watch it. Unless you just miss the characters and want to see them alive again. Even then, I suggest getting ahold o the original series.</p>
<p>Ah, the only one original thing I noticed, is that Face plans out one of the missions, instead of Hannibal.  I don't recall that ever happening in the old series. Did it?</p>
