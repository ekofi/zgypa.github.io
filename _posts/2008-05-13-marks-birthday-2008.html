<p>What a day in NYC. I certainly did a lot. I am very happy.</p>
<p><a name="Summary"></a></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li> Wake up at 6:30 at Tess', take a shower, have breakfast with Tess: leftovers from yesterday's party, i.e. handbaked cookies and cheese cake.</li>
<li> Took train to johnnie's office arriving there 40 minutes late. He is still sleeping, I can't work until he gets there: another 40 minutes.</li>
<li> On my way to Mark's, Olga sends me an SMS: she is ready to talk.</li>
<li> Lunch at Mark Gurarie's: on my way there, I stop by a cake shope and buy a heart shape cake for him. Lunch with him and Catilin, she prepared a nice salad, and sandwiches.</li>
<li> Work at Mark &amp; Catilin's</li>
<li> Olga calls: we decide to meet. All plans are changed to accomodate meeting Olga Lower East Side, 4 J stops away from Mark's.</li>
<li> While I wait for Mark, I wash his dishes. He still isn't there, I start going, and meet him by the stairs.</li>
<li> Meet Olga at Bluestockings bookstore, with his sister. We talk a few blocks away, at the Cake Shop.</li>
<li> Hang out with Olga's sister Martina and Jeff at Cake Shop.</li>
<li> Meet up with Federico there.</li>
<li> Meet up Johnny at his music studio.</li>
<li> We play music with lights out.</li>
<li> Johnny drives me to Tess's.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More</h2>
<p>In the meanwhile, I discovered a bunch of stuff, like Greg Potillo's new music project, and deciding to actually take Olga to the next level.</p>
