<p>Just discovered an annoying bug in mail for iOS: If you have an iPod or iPhone and have an email in the drafts folder you want to finish and send, pay much attention when sending! If there is no network you, like me, might just get a warning of failed delivery, like as usual, except this time it doesn't stay in the outbox, nor does it stay in the drafts. It's gone! This happened to me only for emails I started on the Mac.</p>
