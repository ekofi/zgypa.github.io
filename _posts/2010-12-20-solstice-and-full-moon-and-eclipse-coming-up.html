<p>Ok, so this year's winter silence is coming up. So then I realized it's full moon too. How often can that happen? Not to rarely, however not that often either. I think it's a good intersection of two calendars. </p>
<p>And it's not over! Here will be a full lunar eclipse that mitt as well! Visible from the US mainly, and probably not even there because of clouds. What a magical solstice!</p>
