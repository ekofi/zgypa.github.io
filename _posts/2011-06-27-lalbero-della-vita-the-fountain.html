<p>I particularly enjoyed this movie, suggested by Vittorio Scarselli, seen in Italian, first of all becuase it deals with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Necrophobia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrophobia" rel="wikipedia">fear of dying</a>. I find myself in a phase of life in which i am thinking about it quite a bit. Secondly, it is a movie which does not contain "gratuitous" sex and violence scenes. Thirdly it deals with a spiritual journey, which i am also doing by dealing with personal fears and difficulties.</p>
<p>And so the message the movie expresses, of being close to those who are dying, is very valuable and wholesome. When the time to go arrives, it is important we accept 'Now it is time for dying', and help the person who is dying accept that as well. This is why i certainly suggest the movie.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a class="zem_slink" title="Time travel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel" rel="wikipedia">time travel</a>, the mysticism and the three parallel stories make it even more intriguing. Although, i must admit, i did have the sensation of the story being somehwhat simple, not fully elaborate, as if written by someone with little experience. Mind you, it is not my intention to accuse the Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel (the story-writers) of having little experience. It is my intention to express that i had such impression, that i felt <em>as if</em> the story was poorly taken care of.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this simplicity somewhat makes sense, because the story was supposedly written by Izzi, the woman main character with <a class="zem_slink" title="Brain tumor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor" rel="wikipedia">brain tumor</a>, who started writing only as a consequence of her tumor.</p>
