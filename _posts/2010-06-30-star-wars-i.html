<p>Watched with Olga @Ciapee in English.</p>
<p>Extremely disappointed by the acting, and the story. Ridiculously bad especially queen Amidala. I have no idea how this could have been actually screened. Too much music too! Too much fighting/war scenes. Scenes don't seem to be well tied together.</p>
<p>Great visual effects. Nice the first CPO R2D2 Â encounter. Nice that the queen is a queen and not a king. Nice the mask of Darth Moal.</p>
