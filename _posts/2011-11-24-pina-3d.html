<p>Bello che non era doppiato.</p>
<p>Inquitante, non Ã¨ strutturato in maniera semplice. Va interpretato, bisogna ragionarci sopra.</p>
<p>It's not laid out for the audience. One cannot turn the brain off and watch. So was Pina Bausch's works, probably.</p>
<p>Enigmatic, just as Pina probably was too. Not many words. Through her silence, she gave importance to the few words she did say. That's what i interpreted from the movie.</p>
<p>At first i didn't really understand why make this a 3D movie. Then watching it though, it became clear: it really feals like being there, at a theater. It made sense, its a whole different experience. Especially cool being able to see the performances from angles not possible to be seen when in a theater.</p>
<p>It's sort of a dedica to Pina. Those who have worked with her for years have a chance to send her a 3D message through this movie.</p>
