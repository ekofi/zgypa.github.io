<p>First stop on my way back to Andenes. I have already been here a day or two ago. Was it yesterday? </p>
<p>I met Mirty at the tourist info office. Another wise norwegian. She showed me how I will be taking two busses to Andenes, take a ferry and that I can pay with credit card. She also showed me where I can go for a short walk to tjeldbergtind. </p>
