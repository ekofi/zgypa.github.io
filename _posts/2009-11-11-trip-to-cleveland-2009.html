<p>I left Rossiglione a little late...Â  i had planned to go to stay at Mauro's, however, after having logged off the house, covered the wood and taled to the plumber, i ended up leaving Rossiglione around 2230. So, i decided not to go to Mauro's, who is actually out of the way, and to drive towards Malpensa and look for a hotel. On the way i called a few and all were charging like 80 euros. Decided to sleep in the car instead. So i did, at a gas station. The rest was pretty mellow.</p>
