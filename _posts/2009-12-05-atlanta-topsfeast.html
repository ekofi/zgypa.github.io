<p>Its a great hotel room, like a suite, very nice, i would say even too much. </p>
<p> The first day of the training seession went great: i really liked the energy, it was much more productive than last years, i believe. </p>
<p> The dinner at Cellar 56, which actually had good size portions! I reccomend. The food was great, the portions were normal, not much leftovers. No doggy really necessary. </p>
