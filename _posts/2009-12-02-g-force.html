<p>Walt Disney movie. </p>
<p> Watched on KLM flight AMS JFK dEC 1 2009. </p>
<p> I like how it emphasized the importance of family, and believing in someone. The little creatures became what they became because their master believed in them. </p>
<p> I became what i am because mum and dad and sisters believed in me... And i just told them that... It felt good! </p>
<p> So i reccommend watching the movie. </p>
