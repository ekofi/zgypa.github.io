<p>Ciapee, Italiano</p>
<p>I liked the lighting and the shots of the face. I liked the acting of both James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. I enjoyed the story as well. I liked how it dealt with dominant/submissive relationships and i agree with the critics section of wikipedia, where its stated</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps there is something bold about saying that pain can bring healing as long as it’s applied by the right hand, but even that seems obvious and even normal thanks to [Gyllenhaal].</p></blockquote>
<p>...maybe all this positiveness comes from the fact that the last movie i watches was Star Wars I.</p>
<p>While watching the movie, it seemed to me that Lee was only in love with her boss, because she finally had found somebody who was able to turn her on sexually, and something to take her away from self-harm. Toward the end, though, it became apparent that it was more than simple arousal. Lee liked to be submissive throughout every moment of the day, probably as a product of her dysfunctional family.</p>
<p>Which is another point in favor of this movie: it deals with current issues of society, (reminds me in a way of This American Life, by Ira Glass).</p>
<p>Does this movie pass the Bechdel Test? Yes it does. Lee and her mum talk a few times about the job and the boss, then about the self-harm. And other moments too.</p>
<p>Even though the film is directed by a man, it's story written by two woman (Erin Cressida Wilson and Mary Gaitskill).</p>
