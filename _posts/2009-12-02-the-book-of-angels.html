<p>Secret Chiefs 3, Masada Books 2 </p>
<p> A great CD. I really like how it has a theme, Angels and its followed throughout. Like a book. </p>
<p> I also like the themes of the tunes. Most of them sound fresh and are presented in a way that's not disturbing for me. </p>
<p> I also like the meter of most tunes, which is not very much 4/4 like. </p>
<p> Great usage of effects, really mastered well. Used when appropriate. </p>
<p> I recognized styles used by Ennio Morricone in 'Barakiel' and 'Hamaya', and Herbie Hancock in 'Balberith'. </p>
<p> My favorite today is 'Barakiel': i like how the theme is layed out then developed; i like the theme very much. </p>
<p> Great names for the tunes too. I don't pick up any meaning, if they actually refer to something. Haven't researched yet. However they sound angelic original therefore very appropriate. </p>
<p> There is a background hum throughout the CD. </p>
<p> All in all a very inspiring CD. </p>
