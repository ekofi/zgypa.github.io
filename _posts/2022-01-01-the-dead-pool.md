* This is an inspector Callahan movie from 1988, last of a series of 5.
* Jim Carrey makes a short but important appearance in the movie.
* Liam Neeson, the actor that played Oscar Schindler, is also here. Interestingly, also playing a role in which his character has compiled a list which involves dead people.
* Seen movie with Lisy in English on Netflix.
* Uninteresting movie. Typical movie where the good guy needs only one bullet to kill the bad guy, and the bad guy shoots rounds of machine guns and inspector Callahan doesn't get a single hit.
* Terrible ending, where inspector Callahan kills the unarmed murderer, point blank, with a harpoon, and is revered as a hero, just because the murderer, who is a mentally ill person, has killed others. Pure revenge.
* I give this movie 1 star rating because of it's terrible message. It's not a zero star, only because it is more or less well shot, considering the year it was shot in.
