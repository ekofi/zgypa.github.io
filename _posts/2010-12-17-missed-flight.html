<p>On November 24 2010 i had to be at the MXP airport at 9:15 for the 11:15 flight out to JFK. When i woke up and saw the sun light fill the room, it didn't take me much time to realize it wasn't 5am, actually it was 8 or 9 ish. There was no way plausible i could make it to the airport in time to catch the flight. And the non-plausible way would have involved running out of the house, forgetting who know how many things, and reckless driving to the airport, and a completely stressed out next few hours: been there, done that, no thanks.</p>
<p><em>Great, so i missed the flight</em>, i thought. I was smiling, like i usually do, in order not completely lose it. I was laughing actually. What else could i do? At that point, the deed was done. I was shocked at how i didn't hear the 3 alarms i had set, though (or was it just 2?). Or maybe they actually didn't go off?</p>
<p>My plan was to get dressed, call the travel agency and go to the airport regardless of what they said: in the past once at the check-in counter, they put me on some next flight without too much fuss, even if it was my fault who was late. The travel agent confirmed that the fare was a cheap one, and that i would have lost it all.</p>
<p>So i wrap things up, close the house and as i am leaving, i notice phone calls coming in from private number. <em>Probably mum</em>, i thought, and didn't pick up the phone to avoid somebody else commenting on my lack of ability to organize properly: there was already me doing that, and i assure you, it was enough. Now i had to stick with the plan and hope for the best, or waste a thousand Euros or so.</p>
<p>While driving, i get a message and i learn by reading it, that it actually was the travel agent calling back, to inform me the flight had been delayed! By like almost 3 hours! What a deal! So now, from having lost the flight, i was actually able to sleep in, take advantage of every extra minute AND stop at the bar for breakfast! What a deal!</p>
<p>Is it karma? Or is this a reward from the universe for not developing expectations? At any rate, it doesn't end here, because 3 weeks after the fact, i get a <a href="http://antoniomagni.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/2010_12_17_14_46_00.pdf">Letter of Apologies by Delta Air Lines</a> in the mail from the director of customer care, Toby Broberg, offering free miles as an apology gift! Oh boy. I wanted to answer Toby with a letter, and decided it would take too much time. So i posted this instead. I'll do the letter here, just i caste Toby runs into it:</p>
<blockquote><p>REF# 9541916</p>
<p>Dear Toby,</p>
<p>i really appreciate the apologies you sent out. It's one of those things that helps the customers feel special!</p>
<p>Thanks you Delta Air Lines Inc. for the delayed flight on november 24, 2010! This allowed me not to miss it, because i overslept that morning. So i feel like Delta Air Lines Inc., in a way, has already helped me out, even if unknowingly.</p>
<p>As far as this particular occasion goes, i could happily renounce the 2,500 miles, even if, as a frequent flyer, i could certainly use them. They are however very useful to restore my confidence which might have gotten or might get damaged by other past of future situations.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for coming out and trying to connect with us paying passengers!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Toni Magni</p></blockquote>
