<p>I'm trying to get mdbtools to work on OS X 10.6 and/or amd64 linux. It's so strange how its distributed by debian and macports, compiles fine, however gives obnoxious runtime errors.</p>
<p>The errors i get are the following:</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">$ mdb-ver file.mdb
JET3</pre>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">$ mdb-tables -1 file.mdb
Segmentation fault</pre>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">$ mdb-export file.mdb table
Segmentation fault</pre>
<p>At the beginning i thought it had to do with OS X, however, when i ran into the same symptoms onÂ Linux 2.6.18-6-amd64, i started thinking it could have been a 64bit issue. When Brian Bruns first wrote it, he probably didn't prepare the code for 64bit architecture, making common assumptions such as <em>an int is as big as a long or pointer</em>.</p>
<p>I found some help here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/ILP32toLP64Issues.html">Converting 32-bit Applications Into 64-bit Applications: Things to Consider</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.splint.org/">Splint Home Page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.splint.org/"></a><a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/libgmalloc.3.html">libgmalloc(3) Mac OS X Developer Tools Manual Page</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Splint</h2>
<p>Splint is a utility that will check code for specific issues. In this case, i could use it to make sure that the size of long integers and pointers is 64 bits and the size of plain integers is 32 bits. When using splint, i found these flags to work (i put them in the .splintrc, since that was really the only thing i was using splint for):</p>

<h2>gdb</h2>
<p>I played with gdb and libgmalloc, but not sure if i logged the work i did. When i run it now on linux, i get:</p>
