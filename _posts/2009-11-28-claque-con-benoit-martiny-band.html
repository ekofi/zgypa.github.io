<p>It was a great gig: Nico broke his foot, so we only played 5 pieces, which was perfect, since i had only picked up the instrument 5 days before after a good 3-4 weeks of traveling and crazy madness.</p>
<p>This was the first gig after the recording session. I must say, yet another step ahead. Practicing listening and fine tuning is now the current theme for me.</p>
<p>The Benoit Martiny Band is made up of fine musicians, who are especially nice and social. It was a pleasure to have them around. A good musical match too.</p>
<p>Among the audience there was Olga, Filippo's family with Elisa's grandmother and mother, Camilla. Mec was not feeling well and didn't show up.</p>
