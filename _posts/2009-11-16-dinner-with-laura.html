<p>On friday night i met up with Laura at her place on Hessler. We spent some time trying to decide what to do. During that time she told me how she sometimes needs a third person cuz the one to one is too intense, i guess. So we included Pat. Besides, she felt like hangin out with him too. </p>
<p> we had dinner at the Mint on coventry. I finally had the peanut sauce thai i was craving for. Laura sounds really interested in Pat's food projects and other projects too. They even have a diesel connection now that Pat's got a mercedes. </p>
<p> Laura told me about her missing Olga, the bike accident the twin life and the tyrannic youth and the change after the illness. </p>
