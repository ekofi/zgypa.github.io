<p>I really like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroshell">Zeroshell</a>, and i have faith
in it, but it just keeps giving me headaches. I will have to spend lots of hours
to make it work the way i like it to, which is simply zero maintenance. Right
now it works, sure, if i keep the web admin interface on all day, and keep
fixing when it gets stuck.</p>

<p>I am running the latest zeroshell version on an ALIX2 with no RTC battery, a
satellite connection on ETH01 as Active primary Net Balancer connection and an
EDGE connection on USB via UMTS modem as Spare Net Balancer connection, and here
are the problems i regularly run into:</p>

<ol>

<li>Net Balancer behaves like Load Balancing, even when in Failover mode. This
happens sometimes when one of the two connections fail, then when they come back
up, both connections stay active, and are so in routing table as well. To fix
this, i have to switch to Load Balancing, Save, then switch to Failover, then
save.</li>

<li>Machine doesn't respond for about 30-40 minutes after it has initially
started. The load avg is around 30. This seems to be linked to the fact that i
don't have an RTC battery, so the clock resets to jan 1 2000, and
bandwithd.</li>

<li>Satellite DHCP connection sometimes goes down. In these situations, i have
to go in Setup -&gt;Network and refresh the DHCP lease, and all works
again.</li>

<li>Satellite DHCP connection sometimes fail to activate. This morning, for
example, i woke up and turned on the satellite modem (i had left the ALIX on all
night to avoid the 30-40 minute hi load situation described above). After having
breakfast, zeroshell had still not recognized ETH01 as being active, even though
all the LEDs on the ALIX where OK. A simple de-activating/reactivating of the
interface fixed the problem.</li>

</ol>
