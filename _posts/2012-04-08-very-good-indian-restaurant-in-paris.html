<p>Restaurant Bharath<br />
51 Rue Louis Blanc<br />
75010 Paris<br />

<p>The restaurant was full at lunch time on a Saturday. About 50% Indians, with some customers eating with hands. This is already a very good sign. </p>
<p>I hadn't had food like this in a while. Dishes were spicy without it being mentioned in the menu: just naturally so. I got a Thaali Vegeterian dish for â‚¬8.50 and it was marvelous and just what I wanted: an assortment of 6 or Vegeterian dishes served in a single stainless steel dish with compartments, rice in the middle and a whole wheat plain naan. </p>
<p>Service was fast and efficient. </p>
<p>5 stars, no questions asked.</p>
