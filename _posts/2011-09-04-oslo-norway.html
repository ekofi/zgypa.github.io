<p>Didn't do much, really. Landed from <a class="zem_slink" title="Tromsø" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8" rel="wikipedia">Tromsø</a> at about 18h, looked for hotel and booked single room @ <a class="zem_slink" title="Oslo Airport, Gardermoen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Airport%2C_Gardermoen" rel="wikipedia">Gardermoen Airport</a> Motell for NOK495 over free wifi, which needs a user and pass combination which I got from information desk. S44 to Motell is NOK70 each way. Not bad for an 8 minute ride! Could have walked it. Didn't think about it.</p>
<p>On TV watched <a class="zem_slink" title="Monty Python" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python" rel="wikipedia">Monty Python</a>, not as funny as I hoped. In between, on a different channel, i found myself getting emotional on a Norwegian game show, the one where the team has to guess a sentence using as clues body gestures, no words, no tools, of one of the team members... Interesting. It's not the first time I cry watching people performing in front of others.</p>
<p>However on discovery channel, a documentary on Ed Stafford's <a href="http://www.walkingtheamazon.com/">Walking the Amazon</a> Mission and Cho, who walked the entire length of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon River" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River" rel="wikipedia">Amazon river</a> in about 2,5 years. That's another one of those amazing achievements of man. Apparently nobody had done it in history before.</p>
