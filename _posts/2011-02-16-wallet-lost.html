<p>Today on the train I lost a wallet, the one with the documents in it. I was lucky enough to find friendly police woman who called train guy and ended up finding it. Now it's in Bologna, I'm in Parma. Everything in it but 100 eur. Tomorrow I go pick it up. </p>
<p>I was not too stressed this time. :-) that's all that really matters. </p>
<p>Peace to all!</p>
