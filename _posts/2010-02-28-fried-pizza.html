<p>Fried pizza. Yes. Its more of a fried calzone, actually. Its deepfried, so its important for the oil to be not too used. And one of its most used ingredients is ricotta. </p>

<p> Appearantly, fried pizza is considered by many to be a scottish atrocity. Even wikipedia talks about that kind before writing about Naples. So its not really a fixed aesthetic, like pizza (whatever the recipe, a pizza has to be round, with white, most of the time also red toppings and a rim of dow). Not the fried pizza. </p>
<p> cuz the one i had was more like the fried calzone. Then others make it with two pizza dows, stuffed with whatever filling. Very different aesthetics. </p>
<p> However, it was good, and it wasn't as heavy as i thought, or as it could have been. I recommend, as a Naples experience. </p>
