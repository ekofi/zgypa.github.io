<p>This is another great podcast, which really affected me. I don't think it was because i used to stutter a lot and got much better. I think it's more about the man and his accomplishments: <a class="zem_slink" title="Alan Rabinowitz" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rabinowitz">Alan Rabinowitz</a>.</p>
