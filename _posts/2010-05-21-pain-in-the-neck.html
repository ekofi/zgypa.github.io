<p>Today is day three of a pain in the neck. Yes, two days ago, after making love with Olga, i took a shower and went downstairs, and started sweeping the stairs. That's when the back started to lock up, the entire left side of the spine. I spent that entire day in bed, then the next one. And today, the pain has not subsided. However i have experienced relaxing into the pain, and that seems not to worsen it. When i react to the pain, it worsens.</p>
<p>I try to connect with it as a living being.</p>
