<p>I had a 6 hour layover in Tromsø today. a very sunny day, lots of people outside. I found out that prepaid mobile plans are not that bad here: with less than 10€ I can have a sim card paying about 0,11€/min and 2,5€/day for Internet. Got a new pouch for cell phone and I took me quite some time to pick out a cd to buy. At the end it was Kaia Bremnes. I ordered an €18 sandwich about 15 mins ago. Now I better go see if they will manage to serve it to me within the next 5 minutes, otherwise I might miss the plane. Kind of frustrating: I thought a sandwich would be something quick. <br />In Tromsø, the busses are equipped with special seats for infants or for changing them:<br /><a href="http://antoniomagni.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/20110903-033421.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/09/20110903-033421.jpg" alt="20110903-033421.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>In Norway, shopping centers and big supermarkets have their opening and closing hours posted as huge as the logo on the building itself. Seems strange at first. However of I think about it, I get most frustrated when I walk all the way up to the door only to find out they are closed.<br /><a href="http://antoniomagni.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/20110903-033434.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/09/20110903-033434.jpg" alt="20110903-033434.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
