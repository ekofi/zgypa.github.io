<p>I believe disabling copy/paste into <a class="zem_slink" title="Form (web)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_%28web%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HTML forms</a> to be rude and bad <a class="zem_slink" title="Netiquette" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">netiquette</a> because it's an imposition on to the user and it provides close to no security improvement. (It's sort of like opening links in new tabs or windows: if a user wants to open a link in a new window or tab, the user will do so. It's easy enough to do it with ctrl-click, but it's so much harder to go back to the old website and close that tab.)</p>
<p>Personally, i make use of password assistants to generate very secure passwords and make use of password managers all the time: <a class="zem_slink" title="Cut, copy, and paste" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut%2C_copy%2C_and_paste" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">copying and pasting</a> password is a very essential feature i use on the personal computer. Disabling copy/paste functionality is a tremendous extra effort: so now i have to type in 16-31 random characters twice by hand? Do you know how much time it takes me? I type it once, then i make a mistake, so start all over again, type again... The impression it gives to the user is that the HTML programmers are saying "Look, i'm so good, i even know how to disable copy/paste feature". So it really feels like it's an ego thing, and i don't need it, thanks.</p>
<p>And indeed this is what just happened: i had to change my password on theÂ https://my.t-mobile.com and i had to look at the password and type it twice manually. Something must have gone wrong, because it accepted the changes, but then when i went to login again, it wouldn't let me log in with the new password, and locked my account! To unlock, they sent me a SMS messages, which i cannot read, because the phone is offline now, since i'm in <a class="zem_slink" title="Italy" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=41.9,12.4833333333&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=41.9,12.4833333333 (Italy)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Italy</a>. And all i wanted to do was to check to make sure i had money on the card, and the credit was not expired...</p>
